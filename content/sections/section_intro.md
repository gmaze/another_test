# Introduction to markdown

Markdown makes writing on the web fast and easy. 

> Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

On these documentation pages you will find only the basics, we recommend you to look at:
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) for a more detailed description,
- [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) to get you stared at lighting speed !

## The Basics
We'll introduce you to the basics of standard markdown. 

### Line Breaks
To force a line break, put two spaces and a newline (return) at the end of the line.

* This two-line bullet 
won't break

* This two-line bullet  
will break

Here is the code:

```
* This two-line bullet 
won't break

* This two-line bullet  
will break
```

### Strong and Emphasize

**Strong**: `**Strong**` or `__Strong__` (Command-B)  
*Emphasize*: `*Emphasize*` or `_Emphasize_`[^emphasize] (Command-I)

### Headers (like this one!)
